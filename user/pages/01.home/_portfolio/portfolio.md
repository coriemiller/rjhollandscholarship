# About the Scholarship

<br>

The Richard Holland Memorial Scholarship was established to remember the life and legacy of a great man, friend, son, and brother. Richard Holland was more than any one of these things--he was an infectious personality, a loyal teammate, a genuine smile, and a young soul.

<br>

The Holland Family Legacy Foundation has established the Richard Holland Memorial Scholarship Fund to be awarded annually to a chosen qualified applicant. The purpose of this scholarship is to continue the legacy of Richard Holland--his passion for helping people while enjoying life. This scholarship is a $2,500 award, renewable for up to three additional years.
